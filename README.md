This repository contains my work on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Cleaning, focusing on real-world datasets. Each project highlights how I approach data challenges from start to finish—using a range of SQL techniques to clean, transform, and extract insights.

Techniques Used:

- Standardizing Data by applying CASE logic, data type conversions, and renaming conventions
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) through KPIs such as total revenue, quantity sold, transactions, and average order value (AOV)
- RFM Segmentation using aggregate functions and date calculations
- SQL Optimization through views, temporary tables, and window functions
- Data Transformation with joins, filters, and nested queries
