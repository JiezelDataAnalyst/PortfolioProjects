*### This repository contains my projects which highlights how I approach data challenges from start to finishâ€”using a range of SQL techniques to clean, transform, and extract insights.*

**Techniques Used:**

- Standardizing Data by applying CASE logic, data type conversions, and renaming conventions
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) through KPIs such as total revenue, quantity sold, transactions, and average order value (AOV)
- RFM Segmentation using aggregate functions and date calculations
- SQL Optimization through views, temporary tables, and window functions
- Data Transformation with joins, filters, and nested queries
